### Model Documentation

## Basic Structure

I followed the following steps.

* I started from the simplest logic that makes the car drives without incidents.
* Then, I refactored the alpha version to give it to the structure.
* Finally, I tailered my code as it is structured that I learned from the lesson, 
so that I obtain the insight about the path-planning in the real world, and have the room that I'm going to write advanced logics, 
although it wouldn't change the car's behavior such drasticaly in the simulator.

## Sensors
